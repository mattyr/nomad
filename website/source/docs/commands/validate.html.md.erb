# Command: validate

The `validate` command is used to check a [HCL job specification](/docs/jobspec/index.html)
for any syntax errors or validation problems.

## Usage

```
nomad validate <file>
```

The validate command requires a single argument, specifying the path to a file
containing a [HCL job specification](/docs/jobspec/index.html). This file
will be read and the job checked for any problems.

On successful validation, exit code 0 will be returned, otherwise an exit code
of 1 indicates an error.
